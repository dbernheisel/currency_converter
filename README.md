## Features
- Currency class that holds amounts, currency code, and validations.
- CurrencyConverter class that handles a conversion between two Currency objects with a given exchange rate table.
- CurrencyTrader class that handles analysis between different exchange rates over time.

## Usage
- At your bash terminal, run `ruby trade_currency.rb` and it will output some tests to screen.
- Create a new Currency object: `Currency.new("$100")` or `Currency.new(100, :USD)`
- Handle Currency instances easily for simple math, eg `(Currency.new("$100") + Currency.new("$100")).to_s => $200 USD`
- Convert currencies. Create a new CurrencyConverter instance and pass it the exchange rate hash:
```
currency_rates_20150903 = { rates: {
                                    USD: 1.00000,
                                    EUR: 0.89932,
                                    GBP: 0.65558,
                                    INR: 66.0945,
                                    AUD: 1.42636,
                                    CAD: 1.31838,
                                    ZAR: 13.5868,
                                    NZD: 1.56566,
                                    JPY: 120.085
                                  },
                            date: DateTime.new(2015,9,3)
                          }
converter = CurrencyConverter.new(currency_rates_20150903)
converter.convert(Currency.new("$100"), :EUR) => â‚¬89
```
- Analyze different exchange rates, and source currency code. Create a CurrencyTrader instance `CurrencyTrader.new([currency_rates1, currency_rates2, currency_rates3], :USD)`

- CurrencyTrader methods avaiable:
```
.best_currency(earlier_conversion, later_conversion) => :USD
.profit_in_trade(earlier_conversion, later_conversion) => 1.8
.best_currency_path => [:USD, :GBP, :JPY, etc]
.best_currency_amount => $100000
.give_advice => {1: [olddate, newdate, currency, profit], 2: [olddate, newdate, currency, profit], etc}
```
Sample output of give_advice after some formatting:
```
On 09/03/15 trade to JPY and trade back on 09/04/15 and you'll make $1.20 USD
On 09/04/15 trade to GBP and trade back on 09/07/15 and you'll make $0.00 USD
On 09/07/15 trade to EUR and trade back on 09/11/15 and you'll make $0.80 USD
```
